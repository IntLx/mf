      <p>
        The <a href="RedirectRes\wheatfarm.html">wheat farm in Mleiha, Sharjah</a>, was launched in 2022 to provide food needs and raise production rates to cover the needs of Sharjah's cities and regions. The first phase of wheat cultivation covered an area of 400 hectares. The project will be completed in three phases; the first phase will be on an area of 400 hectares, the second phase will be on an area of 880 hectares in 2024, and the third phase will reach its completion on an area of 1,400 hectares in 2025. The quantities of the <a href="#">UAE’s wheat imports in 2022</a> amounted to 1.7 million metric tonnes, and the share of the emirate of Sharjah is 330,000 metric tonnes. The wheat farm in Mleiha will contribute, after completing its stages and developing its crops, to reduce the percentage of wheat imports from abroad.

    <strong>The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park (MBR Solar Park) is a solar park spread over a total area of 77 km2 in Saih Al-Dahal, about 50 kilometers south of the city of Dubai. It is one of the world's largest renewable projects based on an independent power producer (IPP) model. Besides solar farms using PV technology, the long-term project will also include concentrating solar power (CSP). The total capacity of the entire project is planned to reach 5,000 megawatts (MW).

      The MBR Solar Park is a flagship project of the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, which aims to make Dubai a global hub for clean energy and sustainable living. The project is also aligned with the UAE's National Agenda 2021, which aims to reduce carbon emissions by 23% by 2030.
      
      The MBR Solar Park is being developed in phases. The first phase, which was completed in 2013, has a capacity of 13 MW. The second phase, which was completed in 2017, has a capacity of 200 MW. The third phase, which is currently under construction, will have a capacity of 800 MW. The fourth phase, which is planned to be completed by 2025, will have a capacity of 950 MW. The fifth phase, which is planned to be completed by 2030, will have a capacity of 2,600 MW.
      
      The MBR Solar Park is expected to generate enough electricity to power over 270,000 homes in Dubai. It is also expected to save over 6.5 million tons of carbon emissions annually.
      
      The MBR Solar Park is a major milestone in Dubai's journey towards a sustainable future. It is a testament to the Emirate's commitment to clean energy and its vision for a green economy.</strong>
      <strong>Here are some of the key points and big explanations about the MBR Solar Park:</strong>
      <li>It is the largest single-site solar park in the world.</li>
      <li>It is being developed in phases, with a total capacity of 5,000 MW planned by 2030.</li>
      <li>It is aligned with the UAE's National Agenda 2021 and the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050.</li>
